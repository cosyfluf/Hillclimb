# Hillclimb Racing Clone (Java)

This project is a small attempt to recreate a **Hill Climb Racing** style game in Java.
It’s mainly for learning purposes and experimenting with libraries like **LWJGL** and **JBox2D** for physics and rendering.

## Features (planned / in progress)

* 2D physics-based vehicle movement
* Simple terrain generation
* Basic controls for acceleration and braking
* Fun ragdoll-like physics for the car

## Tech Stack

* **Java** (main language)
* **JBox2D** for physics simulation

## Status

Work in progress – not a full game yet, just a playground to test and learn.
